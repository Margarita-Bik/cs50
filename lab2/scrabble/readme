Exercise "scrabble" by cs50

Complete the implementation of scrabble.c, such that it determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.

Notice that weâ€™ve stored the point values of each letter of the alphabet in an integer array named POINTS.
For example, A or a is worth 1 point (represented by POINTS[0]), B or b is worth 3 points (represented by POINTS[1]), etc.

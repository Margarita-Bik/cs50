Exercise "sort" by cs50

Provided to you are three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!). Your task is to determine which sorting algorithm is used by each file.
